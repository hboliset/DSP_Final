## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Security and Privacy (Fall 2024)** course. The goal is to design, implement, and evaluate a **secure database-as-a-service (DBaaS) system**. The system ensures data security while leveraging cloud services for storage and querying.

### Key Features
- Data encryption to protect sensitive healthcare information.
- Secure storage in a cloud-like environment using SQL databases.
- Implementation of security mechanisms to mitigate semi-trusted cloud risks.
